Now that we have an [A+ spec compliant promise implementation](/blog/2021-10-07-javascript-promises-the-weird-bits/)
lets finish the job by adding the static methods typical implementations provide:

`MyPromise.resolve(value)`: Returns a resolved promise with "value".

`MyPromise.reject(value)`: Returns a rejected promise with "value".

`MyPromise.all(promises)`: Waits for all promises in provided array to resolve, resolves with array of all resolves values.

`MyPromise.race(promises)`: Waits for the first promise to resolve/reject and resolve/rejects with that value.

_There are a few more static methods: `.allSetted()` and `.any()`, however I have never seen them used in the wild, so I am leaving them out._

## MyPromise.resolve(value), MyPromise.reject(value)
Starting simple with .resolve & .reject.
We can construct new promises with a custom executor function that immediately resolves/rejects.
```js
class MyPromise {
  ...

  static resolve(value) {
    // immediately resolve our promise with 'value'
    return new MyPromise((resolve) => resolve(value));
  }

  static reject(value) {
    // immediately reject our promise with 'value'
    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => reject(value));
  }
}
```

## MyPromise.all(promises)
In my experience, this is the most commonly used static method.
Taking an array of promises, it will return a new promise that resolves once *all* given promises have resolved.
If any promises reject, the returned promise rejects.
If all promises resolve, this promise will resolve with an array containing the resolved values of all given promises.

```js
class MyPromise {
  ...

  static all(promises) {
    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      // keep track of all our return values
      const resolvedValues = [];
      let numPromisesResolved = 0;

      // attach a listener to all of our promises so we can store their return value
      // and check if all our promises have resolved
      // if any reject, reject our main promise
      promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
        promise.then(value => {
          // store away our return value for later
          resolvedValues[index] = value;
          // keep track of how many promises have resolved so we know when all are complete
          numPromisesResolved++;

          // check if this was the last promise to resolve
          if (numPromisesResolved === promises.length) {
            // all promises have resolved!
            resolve(resolvedValues);
          }
        });

        // ensure errors are captured
        promise.catch(reject);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

## MyPromise.race(promises)
Similar to `.all(promises)` in that an array of promises is taken, `.race(promises)` watches all promises within an array.
Once *any* promise resolves or rejects, resolve or reject our main promise.
```js
class MyPromise {
  ...

  static race(promises) {
    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      // attach *our* resolve and reject handlers to every promise given
      // promises can only resolve/reject once,
      // so which ever promise settles first will also settle our return promise
      promises.forEach(promise =>
        promise.then(resolve, reject)
      );
    });
  }
}
```
