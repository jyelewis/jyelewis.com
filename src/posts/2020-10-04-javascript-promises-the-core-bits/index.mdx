description: "Hello World 2"

Now that we understand [the history](#) of promises in JavaScript,
let's create a promise implementation from scratch to demystify the internals of promises.

Promises are natively supported [basically everywhere](https://caniuse.com/promises) where JS runs.
However, the [promise specification](https://promisesaplus.com/) can be 100% implemented in pure JS!

The A+ Promise specification implemented in [all major environments](https://caniuse.com/promises)
covers many edge cases and attempts to avoid any undefined behaviour, to ensure all implementations are as consistent as possible.
Let's start by building a "practical" promise implementation, ignoring the weirder edge cases for now.
Then we can flesh our implementation out to be A+ spec compliant in [JavaScript promises: the weird bits](#).

## A starting point
Promises are typically implemented as a class, although the [spec](https://promisesaplus.com/) doesn't require this.
Our promise can be in [one of three states](https://promisesaplus.com/#promise-states): pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
We also need to store our eventual value that we have fulfilled or rejected with,
and an array of handlers to call when the promise changes state from "PENDING" to either "FULFILLED" or "REJECTED"

Putting these starting points together into a little class that can hold our state:
```javascript
class MyPromise {
  // use JavaScript private variables to hold state
  #state; // "PENDING", "FULFILLED" or "REJECTED"
  #fulfilledValue; // the value we FULFILL or REJECT with
  #handlers; // array of functions to call when we FULFILL or REJECT

  constructor() {
    // all promises start their life pending & with no fulfilled value
    this.#state = "PENDING";
    this.#fulfilledValue = undefined;

    this.#handlers = [];
  }
}
```

## Basic usage
Let's create a basic example function that makes use of our new promise class, so we know what to implement next.
A simple method to double a number, with some fake asynchronous should do.
```javascript
function asyncDouble(number) {
  return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (number >= 1000) {
        reject("Cannot double numbers larger than 1000");
        return;
      }

      resolve(number * 2);
    }, 100);
  });
}
```

## 'executor' function
First thing we need is a constructor that can take an 'executor' function.
An executor function is provided to the promise constructor as the first and only argument, it should kick off the async operation.
This function is immediately executed by the promise, and provided 2 arguments when called:
a 'resolve' and 'reject' function to call when the executor has completed the async operation.

Amending our `MyPromise` constructor to take an executor function, call it immediately & provide our resolve & reject methods to the executor:
```javascript
class MyPromise {
  ...

  constructor(executor) {
    ...

    // immediately run our executor function
    // provide it 2 functions (resolve, reject) to call when a result is ready
    executor(
      (value) => this.#resolveWithValue(value),
      (rejectReason) => this.#rejectWithReason(rejectReason)
    );
  }

  #resolveWithValue(value) {
    // if the value we resolved with is not a promise
    // update our local state & store the value we fulfilled with
    this.#state = "FULFILLED";
    this.#fulfilledValue = value;

    console.log("Promise resolved with value", value);
  }

  #rejectWithReason(rejectReason) {
    // update our local state & store the value we rejected with
    this.#state = "REJECTED";
    this.#fulfilledValue = rejectReason;

    console.log("Promise rejected with reason", rejectReason);
  }
}
```

If we now try and run our async double method we can check that it
  1. Immediately returns a `MyPromise` object
  2. Resolves with a value (can test this via the `console.log` we added to our `#resolveWithValue(value)` method)

```javascript
const returnValue = asyncDouble(10);
console.log(returnValue); // MyPromise {}
```
After 100ms we see `Promise resolved with value 20` in the console, so our async task completed successfully!

## Attaching 'then handlers'
Now that we have our foundations, it would be nice to perform some operations **after** our promise has resolved, isn't that the whole point?

Our promise class should have a public `.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)` method available,
so consumers can attach their own handlers to run when a promise resolves or rejects.
All this method needs to do is store a new handler in our private `.#handlers` array, that we can run when a promise changes state.
OR if the promise has already resolved when the consumer attaches a .then method, just call their handlers immediately.

We also need to call these handlers in our `#resolveWithValue` and `#rejectWithReason` methods!

```javascript
class MyPromise {
  ...

  #resolveWithValue(value) {
    // update our local state & store the value we fulfilled with
    this.#state = "FULFILLED";
    this.#fulfilledValue = value;

    // call every handler
    for (const handler of this.#handlers) {
      handler();
    }
  }

  #rejectWithReason(rejectReason) {
    // update our local state & store the value we rejected with
    this.#state = "REJECTED";
    this.#fulfilledValue = rejectReason;

    // call every handler
    for (const handler of this.#handlers) {
      handler();
    }
  }

  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    const handleSettle = () => {
      if (this.#state === "FULFILLED" && onFulfilled) {
        onFulfilled(this.#fulfilledValue)
      }
      if (this.#state === "REJECTED" && onRejected) {
        onRejected(this.#fulfilledValue)
      }
    };

    // check to see if we have already resolved, or are still pending
    // if still pending, store the handler function on our local #handlers array to be called later
    // if already settled, immediately call handleSettle()
    if (this.#state === "PENDING") {
      // not settled yet, store handler so we can call once resolved
      this.#handlers.push(handleSettle);
    } else {
      // already settled
      handleSettle();
    }
  }
}
```

At this point we have a basic functioning promise implementation! Let's test it
```javascript
const asyncDoublePromise = asyncDouble(10);
asyncDoublePromise.then((value) => {
  console.log("Double operation completed:", value);
}, (error) => {
  console.error("Double operation failed:", error);
})
```

## Promises returning promises
A core feature of promises is allowing an executor to call resolve with another promise.
This may seem a little odd, however it allows async tasks to call other async tasks, and will make some chaining easier to implement next.

```javascript
function asyncAddOneAndDouble(number) {
  return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      number = number + 1;

      // resolve with a promise to perform a second task
      resolve(asyncDouble(number));
    }, 100);
  });
}

// this should resolve with the final result of 22
asyncAddOneAndDouble(10).then((result) =>
  console.log("Complete:", result)
);
```

To handle this, we will need to check if the executor called `resolve()` with a promise, rather than a value,
then further wait for that promise to resolve before fulfilling.
Getting a little complicated, but nothing we can't handle.

If the sub-promise resolves: resolve ourselves with the result.
If ths sub-promise rejects: reject ourselves with the reject reason.

```javascript
class MyPromise {
  ...

  #resolveWithValue(value) {
    // check if the value we have 'resolved' with is a promise
    // if so, don't fulfill with this value, instead, wait for it to resolve
    // then try again to resolve with the value of this sub promise
    if (value instanceof MyPromise) {
      // attach a 'then' handler to this promise that we were resolved with
      // once it returns, call resolve/reject again with the value it fulfills to
      value.then.call(value,
        (result) => {
          this.#resolveWithValue(result);
        },
        (rejectReason) => {
          this.#rejectWithReason(rejectReason);
        },
      );
      return;
    }

    // if the value we resolved with is not a promise
    // update our local state & store the value we fulfilled with
    this.#state = "FULFILLED";
    this.#fulfilledValue = value;

    // call every handler, to call .then handlers & resolve .then sub promises
    for (const handler of this.#handlers) {
      handler();
    }
  }

  ...
}
```

## Chaining promises together
We almost have all the pieces together now, however we want the ability to chain our promises together.
```javascript
asyncDouble(5) // 5 -> 10
  .then(asyncDouble) // 10 -> 20
  .then(asyncDouble) // 20 -> 40
  .then(asyncDouble) // 40 -> 80
  .then(result => console.log(result)); // log "80"
```

Using this code with our current implementation throws an error!:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'then' of undefined
```
![Boo](https://media.giphy.com/media/xNRBrdEaYym76/giphy.gif)

Our `.then()` function doesn't return anything! So when we try to call .then() on the return value of .then() we get an error.
To make this code work, our `.then()` function needs to return a _new_ promise. One that resolves once our onResolved handler completes.

Or, in code:
```javascript
const prom1 = asyncDouble(5);
const prom2 = prom1.then((val) => { // prom 2 will resolve once this 'then handler' has completed (including resolving any promise it may return)
  console.log("First promise completed");
  return asyncDouble(val); // return another promise to complete
});
prom2.then((val) => {
  console.log("Second promise completed");
});
```

To implement this, let's wrap our 'then' function in a promise constructor/executor.
When our handler is called, we need to check if we have an appropriate onResolve/onReject handler and call it,
then resolve our sub-promise with the return value of the handler to keep our chain going.

There are a few edge cases here:
  1. If we have no onResolve/onReject handler, resolve/reject our sub-promise immediately to pass the value down the chain.
  2. If we reject, and have a reject handler that executes successfully - the rejection has been 'handled' so resolve the sub promise with the output of the rejection handler
  3. If we reject, and we have **no** reject handler, reject the sub-promise, to ensure the rejection is propagated down (and hopefully eventually handled)

Our final `.then` method, with support for chaining promises:
```javascript
class MyPromise {
  ...

  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    // calling .then always returns a new promise
    // this allows us to chain promises together
    // e.g.
    // fetchData()
    //   .then(parseData)
    //   .then(storeData)
    //   .then(notifyUser)

    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      // we only have one function here for handling both fulfillment & rejection
      // check what state the promise is in when this gets called, and call the appropriate handler function
      // once the handler function has returned,
      // resolve our .then promise with the return value of our handler function
      // if the handler function isn't provided or callable,
      // just resolve our .then promise without calling any handler
      const handleSettle = () => {
        if (this.#state === "FULFILLED") {
          if (onFulfilled) {
            // we have a handler function for this!
            // call it, then resolve with it's return value
            // e.g.
            // doThing() <-- doThing() just resolved
            //   .then(storeResult) <-- call storeResult when doThing state === "FULFILLED" (you are here)
            //   .then(notifyUser) <-- another .then handler is attached to the promise returned by .then(storeResult)
            resolve(onFulfilled(this.#fulfilledValue));
          } else {
            resolve(this.#fulfilledValue);
          }
        } else { // rejected
          if (onRejected) {
            resolve(onRejected(this.#fulfilledValue));
          } else {
            reject(this.#fulfilledValue);
          }
        }
      };

      // check to see if we have already resolved, or are still pending
      // if still pending, store the handler function on our local #handlers array to be called later
      // if already settled, immediately call handleSettle()
      if (this.#state === "PENDING") {
        // not settled yet, store handler so we can call once resolved
        this.#handlers.push(handleSettle);
      } else {
        // already settled
        handleSettle();
      }
    });
  }

  ...
}
```

## Convenience methods
If you've made it this far, well done! That's it for the hairy parts. Let's just add some convenience methods to making using our promise class a little nicer.

### .catch()
`.catch()` is simply a wrapper around `.then()`, it allows attaching a handler specifically for rejections only.

### .finally()
`.finally()` is also a wrapper around `.then()`, it allows attaching a handler to run on either fulfillment or rejection of a promise.

```javascript
class MyPromise {
  ...

  // convenience method, attach reject handler
  catch(onRejected) {
    this.then(undefined, onRejected);
  }

  // convenience method, handler to run either resolve or reject
  finally(onFinally) {
    this.then(onFinally, onFinally);
  }

  ...
}
```

## Putting it all together
We have our final class! It's not perfectly compliant to the spec yet, but for most use cases the difference won't be noticeable.

```javascript
class MyPromise {
    // use JavaScript private variables to hold state
    #state; // "PENDING", "FULFILLED" or "REJECTED"
    #fulfilledValue; // the value we FULFILL or REJECT with
    #handlers; // array of functions to call when we FULFILL or REJECT

    constructor(executor) {
        // all promises start their life pending & with no fulfilled value
        this.#state = "PENDING";
        this.#fulfilledValue = undefined;

        this.#handlers = [];

        // immediately run our executor function
        // provide it 2 functions (resolve, reject) to call when a result is ready
        executor(
            (value) => this.#resolveWithValue(value),
            (rejectReason) => this.#rejectWithReason(rejectReason)
        );
    }

    #resolveWithValue(value) {
        // check if the value we have 'resolved' with is a promise
        // if so, don't fulfill with this value, instead, wait for it to resolve
        // then try again to resolve with the value of this sub promise
        if (value instanceof MyPromise) {
            // attach a 'then' handler to this promise that we were resolved with
            // once it returns, call resolve/reject again with the value it fulfills to
            value.then.call(value,
                (result) => {
                    this.#resolveWithValue(result);
                },
                (rejectReason) => {
                    this.#rejectWithReason(rejectReason);
                },
            );
            return;
        }

        // if the value we resolved with is not a promise
        // update our local state & store the value we fulfilled with
        this.#state = "FULFILLED";
        this.#fulfilledValue = value;

        // call every handler, to call .then handlers & resolve .then sub promises
        for (const handler of this.#handlers) {
            handler();
        }
    }

    #rejectWithReason(rejectReason) {
        // update our local state & store the value we rejected with
        this.#state = "REJECTED";
        this.#fulfilledValue = rejectReason;

        // call every handler, to call .then handlers & resolve .then sub promises
        for (const handler of this.#handlers) {
            handler();
        }
    }

    then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
        // calling .then always returns a new promise
        // this allows us to chain promises together
        // e.g.
        // fetchData()
        //   .then(parseData)
        //   .then(storeData)
        //   .then(notifyUser)

        return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
            // we only have one function here for handling both fulfillment & rejection
            // check what state the promise is in when this gets called, and call the appropriate handler function
            // once the handler function has returned,
            // resolve our .then promise with the return value of our handler function
            // if the handler function isn't provided or callable,
            // just resolve our .then promise without calling any handler
            const handleSettle = () => {
                if (this.#state === "FULFILLED") {
                    if (onFulfilled) {
                        // we have a handler function for this!
                        // call it, then resolve with it's return value
                        // e.g.
                        // doThing() <-- doThing() just resolved
                        //   .then(storeResult) <-- call storeResult when doThing state === "FULFILLED" (you are here)
                        //   .then(notifyUser) <-- another .then handler is attached to the promise returned by .then(storeResult)
                        resolve(onFulfilled(this.#fulfilledValue));
                    } else {
                        resolve(this.#fulfilledValue);
                    }
                } else { // rejected
                    if (onRejected) {
                        resolve(onRejected(this.#fulfilledValue));
                    } else {
                        reject(this.#fulfilledValue);
                    }
                }
            };

            // check to see if we have already resolved, or are still pending
            // if still pending, store the handler function on our local #handlers array to be called later
            // if already settled, immediately call handleSettle()
            if (this.#state === "PENDING") {
                // not settled yet, store handler so we can call once resolved
                this.#handlers.push(handleSettle);
            } else {
                // already settled
                handleSettle();
            }
        });
    }

    // convenience method, attach reject handler
    catch(onRejected) {
        this.then(undefined, onRejected);
    }

    // convenience method, handler to run either resolve or reject
    finally(onFinally) {
        this.then(onFinally, onFinally);
    }
}
```

Now lets see if we can tweak this implementation to become 100% [A+ specification compliant](https://promisesaplus.com/)
