It doesn't take long working with JavaScript before the big bad wolf of asynchronous operations comes out to play.
In Python we can just
```python
my_ip = urllib.request.urlopen('https://api.ipify.org').read().decode()
print(my_ip)
```
But JS requires
```javascript
const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = () => {
    const myIp = req.responseText
    console.log(myIp);
};
req.open('get', 'https://api.ipify.org');
req.send();
```

What is going on? Why is JS this so different in approach to other languages!?

## JS origins
JavaScript has evolved from a language designed to add small amounts of interactivity to a webpage.
In this basic form, code must 'block' the web browsers rendering while executing:
If a user clicks a button, we must execute our button handling code before we allow them to interact anymore with the page.
This makes implementing webpage interactivity simple, but presents a problem for long-running tasks, such as making API requests.

In our previous Python code, our execution 'pauses' while we wait for our API to respond to our request. This makes the code very easy to read and write.
If our Javascript did the same thing, our entire web page would freeze up!
Instead of pausing, JS takes a 'callback' approach, where a long-running request starts (e.g., an API request),
and we provide a function to 'call back' once this request has completed.
This allows our browser to keep performing other tasks while we wait for the server.

Some other languages/frameworks also use this pattern to ensure user interfaces remain fast. For example Swift on iOS, which makes heavy use of 'delegates' to allow asynchronous operations
```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://api.ipify.org")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "GET"
NSURLConnection.sendAsynchronousRequest(request, queue: OperationQueue.main) {(response, data, error) in
    guard let data = data else { return }
    print(String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)!)
}
```
iOS requires this for the same reason that the browser does: if an application 'paused' execution while we waited on an API call to complete, our devices would appear to 'freeze' continuously while background operations complete.

## Callback hell
Through the rise of interactive web applications, JavaScript grew from simple sprinkles of interactivity to fully fledged business logic.
As this logic became more complicated, the 'simple' solution of callbacks started to grow in complexity.

Often many async operations need to be chained together, one after the other, to create one larger workflow.
For example, we may want to
  1. fetch some data
  2. parse that data
  3. store the result
  4. notify the user

Each step here requires the previous to have completed. JavaScript traditionally has used callbacks,
allowing the developer to provide a function to call once an async operation has completed.

```js
function onFetchDataComplete(error, data) {
    if (error) {
        console.error("fetchData failed :(", error);
    } else {
        console.log("fetchData complete!", data);
    }
}

fetchData(onFetchDataComplete);
```

Using this callback pattern for our larger workflow, things start to become a little complex.

```js
fetchData((fetchDataError, data) => {
    if (fetchDataError) {
        console.error(fetchDataError);
        return;
    }

    parseData(data, (parseDataError, parsedData) => {
        if (parseDataError) {
            console.error(parseDataError);
            return;
        }

        storeResult(parsedData, (storeError) => {
            if (storeError) {
                console.error(storeError);
                return;
            }

            notifyUser((notifyError) => {
                if (notifyError) {
                    console.error(storeError);
                    return;
                }

                console.log("Process completed");
            });
        });
    });
});
```

This tree structure is colloquially known as 'nested callback hell'
as every operation adds another layer of nesting and code becomes very difficult to maintain and read.


## The promise land
Enter promises: while callbacks solve a problem, they don't solve it in a particularly logical way. Typically functions are called, and they return a result.
This callback pattern doesn't make use of return values, and instead we must provide arguments on what to do once the function is complete.

Promises take us back to more familiar patterns: a function can be called with relevant arguments, and it will return a value.
However, async functions still cannot block execution. The program must continue running, even if the return value isn't ready yet.

To work around this problem, async functions can return a 'promise' which will in the future, contain the return value of the operation.
This allows async functions to return _something_ immediately, even if they are still waiting on, for example, an API call to complete.

Promises are an object, with 3 states: pending, fulfilled and rejected. Typically, an async operation will return a promise in the 'pending' state.
This indicates that an operation is still in progress, but a value will be available in the future.
'Then handlers' can be attached to this promise in order to perform some task once the promise 'resolves' to the 'fulfilled' state.
When this 'then handler' is called, the value the promise resolved with will be provided as the first argument to the handler function.

Re-writing our [first example](#small-callback-workflow) of fetching data using promises:
```js
const fetchDataPromise = fetchData();
fetchDataPromise
    .then(data => console.log("fetchData complete!", data))
    .catch(error => console.error("fetchData failed :(", error));
```

This is more concise than our earlier example using callbacks, but not significantly better.
The value of promises starts to really show when chaining many async operations together, as we did in [here](#large-callback-workflow)
<a id="large-promise-workflow"></a>
```js
fetchData()
    .then(parseData)
    .then(storeResult)
    .then(notifyUser)
    .then(() => console.log("Process complete!"))
    .catch(console.error);
```

Wow! That's an improvement on our callback hell code!

The secret sauce here is that promises are designed to allow chaining.
Each time we attach a 'next' function to run in the chain via `.then`,
a new promise is returned that will resolve with the value of our next handler.
This is a little confusing, but essentially our code above is creating 5 promises:
  1. A promise that resolves when fetchData completes.
  2. A promise that resolves when parseData completes.
  3. A promise that resolves when storeResult completes.
  4. A promise that resolves when notifyUser completes.
  5. A promise that resolves when our `console.log("process complete")` completes (immediately).

We are attaching '`.then`' handlers to each of these promises, to extend the chain of operations.

There is another interesting line in the two examples above: `.catch()`.
This attaches a handler to run if a promise 'rejects', that is fails to complete its async operation.
If a promise rejects, and sub promises returned by `.then()` handlers will also reject.
This allows us to attach only a single error handler at the bottom of our promise chain,
rather than handling errors at every stage in our async process like we did in the [callback workflow](#large-callback-workflow)

## async/await
In the modern JS environment we can take promises a step further with async functions.
This syntax allows automatically moving blocks of code into 'then' handlers, allowing developers to write code that reads clearly.
Converting our example code to use async/await:
```javascript
async function runWorkflow() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    const parsedData = await parseData();
    await storeResult(parsedData);
    await notifyUser();

    console.log("Process complete!");
}
```

This final code is much easier to read, write, and maintain. Certainly much simpler than our original [callback workflow](#large-callback-workflow)!

It's important to note that this async/await syntax is still using promises under the hood.
In fact our `runWorkflow()` is implicitly returning a promise that will resolve when the workflow completes, or reject if it fails.

Now that you know the what and why of promises, let's look at [the core bits](#) of a promise implementation!
